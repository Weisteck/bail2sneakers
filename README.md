# The project
This project is realized within the framework of a school project, we decided to make an e-commerce site on the theme of sneaker sales.

The website part is on this git, for the mobile part ðŸ“± : [it's here](https://github.com/Weisteck/bail2sneakersMobile/tree/main).

This is a first version that can be improved later and does not have all the features in e-commerce site competition.
